# CS 4641 Semester Project
_Created by Joshua Donegal & Brian Compau(?)_

## Introduction/Background
The effect of horror within the game genre is largely correlated with the atmosphere of the game’s environment. A major component of this atmosphere is the musical score/soundtrack/composition. Being able to identify which instruments and their frequency in both successful and unsuccessful horror games is vital to the evolution of the genre as composers look to create increasingly complex original soundtracks and create more successful horror games.

## Problem Definition
Identify the instruments that comprise the composition of original soundtracks for horror games prior to the year 2000 and analyze the composition in terms of sales and scores on popular gaming sites, such as Steam and MetaCritic.

## Methods
We will be using supervised learning to identify the frequency of instrument use in successful games. We will be analysing video game release data, success data, and the original soundtracks as features in the matrix. A video game’s success is determined by total sales, rate of sales, and a rating derived from user ratings and journalism reviews across many sources (e.g. Steam). Furthermore, we will be utilizing several different models, and choosing the best model in accordance to their results and accuracy.

## Potential Results & Discussion
Our first intuition is that the most common instruments may be the waterphone, instruments synonymous with the term “horror” due to their eerie and sharp tone with a wide range of pitches, the organ, and synthesizers. 

## Timeline
October 18th- Have complete dataset(s)
November 1st- First checkpoint for team’s coding process (internal)
November 16th (Midpoint Checkpoint)- First Prototype done (ok if there are some bugs in it)
December 1st- Minimum Viable Product (the next week will be for checking the project for rare/well-hidden bugs and checking it against project requirements)
December 7th (Final Project Due)- Completed Project

Each member’s individual responsibilities will be decided in weekly scrum meetings.
